## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Step 1: Clone and Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd academic-portal

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/academic_portal

# JWT Secret (use a secure random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here

# Email Configuration (optional)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password

# File Upload Configuration
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=jpg,jpeg,png,pdf,doc,docx
```

### Step 3: Database Setup
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:

```bash
# For local MongoDB
mongod

# Or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud) by updating MONGODB_URI in .env
```

### Step 4: Start the Application
```bash
# Development mode (with auto-restart)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and role-based authorization:

### User Roles
- **Student**: Can enroll in courses, submit assignments, view grades
- **Teacher**: Can create courses, manage assignments, grade submissions
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management

### Protected Routes
All API endpoints (except registration and login) require authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## 📁 File Upload

The system supports file uploads for:
- Profile pictures
- Assignment submissions
- Course materials

Supported file types: JPG, JPEG, PNG, PDF, DOC, DOCX
Maximum file size: 5MB (configurable)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Database Models

#### User Model

- Instructor assignment
- Student enrollment tracking
- Schedule and capacity management

#### Assignment Model

### Middleware

#### Authentication Middleware

#### Role Middleware
- Restricts access based on user roles
- Supports multiple role requirements
- Resource ownership validation

#### Error Handler
- Global error handling
- Standardized error responses
- Development vs production error details

## 🚦 Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the server with nodemon for automatic restarts on file changes.

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Logging
The application logs all requests and errors:
- Access logs: `server/logs/access-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Error logs: `server/logs/error-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Security logs: `server/logs/security-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

## 🔒 Security Features
